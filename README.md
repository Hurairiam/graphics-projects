# 🎨 Graphics Projects

This repository is a collection of my AI-assisted and manually designed graphics.  
Each folder showcases creative projects that combine **artistic design** with **AI implementation**.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- **AI-Implemented/** — Projects where artificial intelligence (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) was used to generate, refine, or assist in design creation.
- *(Future folders may include manual design projects or collaborations.)*

## 🧠 Tools Used
- **ChatGPT** (for concept generation, prompt writing, and refinement)
- **Gemini** (for actual image creation and layout)
- **Canva / Figma / Photoshop** (optional post-processing or layout)
- **PDF tools** (for combining final designs into presentation format)
